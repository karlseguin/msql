# MonetDB CLI

Pretty basic right now, but actively being worked on. Check back in a few weeks.

An alternative to mclient. Featuring:

1. pgpass support
2. Multiline history
3. More connection options (e.g., role, schema)
4. Some psql shortcuts (e.g., \x on|off)


TODO:
1. Add CSV output
2. Add support for \d+ and maybe \c
